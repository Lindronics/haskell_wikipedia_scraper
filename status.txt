Does the code run?


The code compiles without problems. It passes all provided unit tests.
It should work completely according to specification and is fully documented with Haddock comments.


Implementation


To make sure junk CSS code gets removed from the list of words, I added a second selector that retrieves all text enclosed within style tags to the scraper. I then add the stripped tokens from that list to the list of stop words.

The code should be fairly well-optimized for performance. For counting word occurrences and stripping stop words I use maps. These operations should run with O(nlog(n)) and O(n+m) runtimes respectively.


Part B


For part B, I decided to generate a .tex file using HaTeX and the matrix package, displaying a report containing a table with the results. Furthermore, the code reads the contents of this file and the report.txt file and adds them as sections to the LaTeX document.

The LaTeX output is well-formed and compiles with TeXLive. The file is stored in the tex subdirectory, to keep the main project directory clean of all the auxiliary LaTeX files. You can find the example output there.
